## Defining Levels of ADA Compliance


1. Level A (minimum) - The most basic web accessibility features. Sets a minimum level of accessibility, but does not generally achieve broad accessibility for many situations.
2. Level AA (mid-range) - Deals with the biggest and most common barriers for disabled users.
3. Level AAA (highest) - The highest level of web accessibility. It is often not possible to satisfy all Level AAA success criteria for some content types.

Websites must be optimized to work in conjunction with assistive technology. Poorly designed websites can create barriers for disabled citizens, limiting, or completely inhibiting, their ability to obtain all available information from your local government website.

In addition, local governments must understand that a website serves as the gateway to their communities. Understand that accessibility prudence:
Impacts 19% of citizens
Increases site traffic
Improves search engine optimization (SEO)
Is a legal best practice
